# Data-410-Project-4

1. Create your own multiple boosting algortihm and apply it to combinations of different regressors (for example you can boost regressor 1 with regressor 2 a couple of times) on the "Concrete Compressive Strength" dataset.  Show what was the combination that achieved the best cross-validated results.

2. (Research) Read about the LightGBM algorithm and include a write-up that explains the method in your own words. Apply the method to the same data set you worked on for part 1.
